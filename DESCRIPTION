Description: Aims at gathering in a single place a set of variables adapted 
    that could be useful to researchers or practitioners that use the 
    structural gravity model of trade. We provide trade flows, as well as 
    geographic, cultural, trade facilitation and macroeconomic variables. The
    tables provided here were reshaped under Cobb's Normal Form, and in some 
    cases contain corrections that we explain in the GitHub repository. The 
    specific sources are the Gravity database from the Center for Prospective
    Studies and International Information (CEPII), the International Trade 
    and Production Database for Estimation (ITPD-E) and the Dynamic Gravity 
    Database (DGD) from the US International Trade Commission (USITC), and
    the Structural Gravity Database (SGD) from the World Trade Organization 
    (WTO).
