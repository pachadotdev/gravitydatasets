\description{
Allows for a full identification of each country included in the
gravity dataset and, if relevant, for a tracking of its territorial changes
(splits and merges).  Includes one observation for each territorial
configuration, mapping the full set of territorial changes that are
accounted for in gravity. For example, this dataset includes one observation
for West Germany, one for East Germany and one for the unified Germany.
}
\details{
There are differences with respect to the original Stata version.
ISO3 alphabetic codes of length zero were converted to NAs and the
attributes (i.e., column descriptions), when missing, were added after
reading the original documentation. The dynamic codes were added to the
dataset and follow from USITC's DGD codes
